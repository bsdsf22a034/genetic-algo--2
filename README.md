Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:

GAs can handle complex and poorly understood search spaces.
They are adaptable and can be used for multi-modal optimization.
Disadvantages:

They can be computationally intensive.
Thereâ€™s no guarantee of finding the global optimum, as they can get stuck in local optima.
Overall, genetic algorithms are a powerful tool for solving complex optimization problems by mimicking the process of natural selection and evolution.
